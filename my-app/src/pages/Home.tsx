                Hello! My name is Ann Marie Frisby and I am 
                very excited to show you my work throughout the years. 
                While my skills grow overtime, I am excited to use this
                website as a time capsule of all my work throughout the
                past and to show how I've been able to grow over time!

            I was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
            I am currently an alumnus of East 
            Ascension High School, which is located 
            in a small city named Gonzales in Ascension Parish. 
            My story begins in my junior year of high school, when 
            i decided to take my first ever Premiere Pro class. Of 
            course, I fell in love. I decided that I wanted to go above
            and beyond and try out the whole Adobe Creative Suite. In my 
            senior year of high school, I was able to get certifications 
            in Premiere Pro, Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop.

            <h6> I started college like every other freshman. Lost. This led 
                me to want to change my major 3 times in a 1-year span. From 
                Studio Arts to Screen Arts, to Mass Communications. Along the way,
                I was able to pick up a couple of skills. This includes learning about 
                design, branding, and color theory. It also led me to learn about video
                directing, producing, and editing, as well as lighting, sound, and gaffing.
                I was blessed to get the opportunities I did while trying to figure out the 
                type of content creator I wanted to become.</h6>
